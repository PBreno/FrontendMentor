      <p>
        2-3 large eggs
        Salt, to taste
        Pepper, to taste

      <p>
        Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

        Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.

        Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
        the eggs evenly coat the surface.

        Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.

        Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.

        Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
